### Why
A study on developing a single page web app (SPA), just using modern Javascript browsers built-in API.
No `angular/react/npm` required. No compile or transpile step, source code is understood by the browser as is.
 

### Dependencies
1. Uses [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/guide) for rendering html templates.
2. Uses [luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) for date-time conversions.
3. Uses [flatpickr](https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr) for date picker UI.
4. Uses [less](https://lesscss.org/) for succinct style definitions
